  - Windows Event Logs (JSON format)  
  - CSV security alerts
  - Custom JSON formats

✓ OLLAMA/LLM Integration
  - Uses local AI models (llama3, mistral, etc.)
  - Intelligent threat pattern recognition
  - Context-aware security analysis
  - Natural language report generation

✓ Advanced Security Features
  - Input sanitization against injection attacks
  - Memory-safe C++ implementation
  - Resource management and error handling
  - Comprehensive logging and auditing

✓ Professional Reporting
  - Executive summaries with threat statistics
  - Detailed threat analysis with IoCs
  - Actionable security recommendations
  - Multiple output formats (text, HTML, JSON)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================

Analysis completed at: 2025-08-05 14:30:21
Total threats identified: 4

Threat Breakdown:
  • Critical: 2
  • High: 1  
  • Medium: 1
  • Low: 0

⚠️  IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Critical priority threats detected.

THREAT ANALYSIS
===============

Threat 1: CRITICAL Priority
Type: malware_detected
Description: Trojan.Generic.12345 detected in C:\temp\suspicious.exe
Source IP: 192.168.1.50
Confidence: 98%
Indicators:
  • Malicious file detected in temporary directory  
  • Known trojan signature match
  • Endpoint security alert triggered
Recommendations:
  • Immediately isolate affected host 192.168.1.50
  • Run full system scan and malware removal
  • Check for lateral movement indicators
  • Review user activity on compromised system

Threat 2: CRITICAL Priority  
Type: privilege_escalation
Description: Unauthorized elevation to admin privileges
Source IP: 192.168.1.10
Confidence: 92%
Indicators:
  • Suspicious privilege escalation detected
  • No corresponding authorization in access logs
  • Potential insider threat or compromise
Recommendations:
  • Investigate user account and recent activity
  • Review authentication logs for anomalies
  • Check for unauthorized software installation
  • Consider temporary account suspension

Threat 3: HIGH Priority
Type: brute_force
Description: SSH Brute force attack detected from 192.168.1.100
Source IP: 192.168.1.100
Target IP: 192.168.1.10
Confidence: 95%
Indicators:
  • Multiple failed SSH login attempts
  • Sequential attempts against different accounts
  • Attack targeting administrative accounts
Recommendations:
  • Immediately block source IP 192.168.1.100
  • Implement fail2ban or similar protection
  • Review SSH security configuration
  • Enable key-based authentication

Threat 4: MEDIUM Priority
Type: blocked_connection
Description: Blocked suspicious connection attempt on port 4444
Source IP: 203.0.113.25
Target IP: 192.168.1.10
Confidence: 75%
Indicators:
  • Connection attempt to non-standard port
  • External IP attempting internal access
  • Firewall successfully blocked attempt
Recommendations:
  • Monitor for additional attempts from this IP
